# Description: A place for my class notes for Week 11 of Promineo Tech Front End Bootcamp

---

I missed the last week of class and notes due to baby being born. :) [We've been sick, too! ugh]

And I started class late today because I got back late from getting food for my family.

[breathing, feeling mild anxiety about this, sadly]

Not going to learn all the APIs.

DOM is an API

Canvas API for graphics

Geolocation API has to ask permission for location. Has to.

Drag and Drop API; Media Streaming Recording APIs.... Vibration API, speech, we b crypto. XMLHttpRequest (one of the original APIs)

Tic Tac Toe assignment.

Adding events. clickable events in JS and AJAX, JQuery, and w API. [DOM =/= AJAX?]

call back event listener; function passed to another function.

interesting
